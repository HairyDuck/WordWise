## 📖 About WordWise

WordWise is an open-source browser extension designed to enhance the web reading experience for individuals with dyslexia. By bolding the first third of each word on a webpage, WordWise makes text easier to read and comprehend, creating a more inclusive web browsing experience for dyslexic individuals. 

Living with dyslexia can present challenges when reading online content. WordWise offers a simple yet effective solution by transforming and emphasizing words to alleviate reading difficulties. Whether you're a student, a professional, or an avid reader, WordWise empowers you to overcome obstacles and enjoy a more enjoyable reading experience on the web.

## 🎯 Features

- **Word Transformation**: WordWise intelligently modifies every word on a webpage, ensuring optimal readability for dyslexic users. This feature is based on a new approach to reading known as 'bionic reading', which guides readers through text using "artificial fixation points". By bolding or highlighting the letters at the beginning of a word, a reader's brain can identify them with less effort and concentration. This technique speeds up reading as it reduces the need to focus on the entirety of every word.

- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the intensity of the word transformation effect, choose your preferred font style, or even disable the extension on specific websites. These settings are designed to be user-friendly and customizable to each individual's preferences, ensuring that WordWise is as effective as possible for each user.

- **Seamless Integration**: WordWise integrates seamlessly into your browser, automatically applying its dyslexia-friendly enhancements to any webpage you visit. This means you can browse the web as you normally would, with the added benefit of WordWise's enhancements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can install WordWise from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/egejahhddjlpaikkhjbnjblmbaednkfk). Once installed, WordWise will automatically begin transforming text on webpages. You can customize your settings at any time by clicking on the WordWise icon in your browser toolbar.

## 📚 Case Study

A new approach to reading, known as 'bionic reading', has been gaining attention. This method, developed by typography expert Renato Casutt, guides readers through text using "artificial fixation points". By bolding or highlighting the letters at the beginning of a word, a reader's brain can identify them with less effort and concentration. This technique speeds up reading as it reduces the need to focus on the entirety of every word. You can read more about this approach in this [HuffPost article](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-bionic-reading-does-it-work_uk_628749a3e4b05cfc268a59ff).

## 📝 To Do

been proven to improve readability for individuals with dyslexia.
