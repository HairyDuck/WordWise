## üìñ About WordWise

WordWise is an open-source browser extension designed to enhance the web reading experience for individuals with dyslexia. By bolding the first third of each word on a webpage, WordWise makes text easier to read and comprehend, creating a more inclusive web browsing experience for dyslexic individuals. 

Living with dyslexia can present challenges when reading online content. WordWise offers a simple yet effective solution by transforming and emphasizing words to alleviate reading difficulties. Whether you're a student, a professional, or an avid reader, WordWise empowers you to overcome obstacles and enjoy a more enjoyable reading experience on the web.

## üéØ Features

- **Word Transformation**: WordWise intelligently modifies every word on a webpage, ensuring optimal readability for dyslexic users. This feature is based on a new approach to reading known as 'bionic reading', which guides readers through text using "artificial fixation points". By bolding or highlighting the letters at the beginning of a word, a reader's brain can identify them with less effort and concentration. This technique speeds up reading as it reduces the need to focus on the entirety of every word.

- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the intensity of the word transformation effect, choose your preferred font style, or even disable the extension on specific websites. These settings are designed to be user-friendly and customizable to each individual's preferences, ensuring that WordWise is as effective as possible for each user.

- **Seamless Integration**: WordWise integrates seamlessly into your browser, automatically applying its dyslexia-friendly enhancements to any webpage you visit. This means you can browse the web as you normally would, with the added benefit of WordWise's enhancements.


## üöÄ Getting Started

You can install WordWise from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/egejahhddjlpaikkhjbnjblmbaednkfk). Once installed, WordWise will automatically begin transforming text on webpages. You can customize your settings at any time by clicking on the WordWise icon in your browser toolbar.

## üìö Case Study

A new approach to reading, known as 'bionic reading', has been gaining attention. This method, developed by typography expert Renato Casutt, guides readers through text using "artificial fixation points". By bolding or highlighting the letters at the beginning of a word, a reader's brain can identify them with less effort and concentration. This technique speeds up reading as it reduces the need to focus on the entirety of every word. You can read more about this approach in this [HuffPost article](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-bionic-reading-does-it-work_uk_628749a3e4b05cfc268a59ff).

## üìù To Do

- **Dyslexia-friendly font substitution**: Substitute fonts with dyslexia-friendly options for improved readability. This feature will allow users to choose from a selection of fonts that have

been proven to improve readability for individuals with dyslexia.

- **Redesigned options popup**: Enhance the design and user experience of the options popup. We aim to create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to customize their WordWise settings.

- **Browser Support**: Extend support to Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari. We understand the importance of accessibility across all platforms and are working to make WordWise available on these popular browsers.

- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of WordWise. This will help us catch and fix bugs early, and ensure that new features don't break existing functionality.

- **Add More Screenshots**: Include more screenshots in the README to provide a visual guide of WordWise's features and settings. This will help users understand how to use and customize WordWise.

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of WordWise to ensure it runs smoothly even on webpages with a large amount of text. This could involve optimizing the word transformation algorithm, or implementing features like lazy loading.

- **Linting**: Implement a linting system to ensure code quality and consistency. This will help us maintain a clean and readable codebase, making it easier for contributors to understand and work with the code.

- **Localization**: Translate WordWise into multiple languages to make it accessible to non-English speakers. We would love to have community contributions for translations!
